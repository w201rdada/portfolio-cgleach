## A beginning.

Over the past decade the United States has seen a sustained trend of individuals moving from the periphery into urban centers.  Unfortunately, the infastructure required to accomodate these demographic shifts has not been built, and as a result traffic has increased.  And while it may be easy to forget, traffic doesn't simply cause emotional and mental anguish!  In 2013 The Centre for Economics and Business Research, in collaboration with INRIX, released a study that estimated the cost of congestion to be $1,700 for a car owning household.


## A middle.

In the absense of massive infastructure investment, states must begin to consider alternatives to reduce both the direct and indirect costs of traffic.  One solution would be to implement dynamic pricing, charging individuals a variable rate to drive on a highway depending on specific factors, such as time of day, road conditions, etc.  If done correctly, this has the potential to significantly reduce traffic and raise money which can be used to fund additional projects.  In many ways this would represent a form of price discovery, with individuals who are willing to pay more doing so, and those who could chooes to drive at a different time having the option to save money. However if this undertaking is to be achieved, a complex model capable of predicting traffic given a variety of inputs must be created.  

A MVP of this model could be designed using publically available traffic, weather, demographic, and toll data.  Several model types should be considered, including a random forest and varying neural net approaches.  As state's begin to implement this model their new data would feed back into the system, helping to improve the efficacy of the model.  Because of this, the project has the potential for exponential data growth, and a robust storage and machine learning stack will be required that can easily scale. (AWS/Google Cloud, etc.)

## An end.

Upon the completion of the model, states would have the ability to model their expected  traffic vs. price function, and take steps to more appropriately allign reality with the state's societal and economic goals.  If implemented, the expectation would be an increase in economic activity, and a reduction in lost time.  Yet this proposal is not without flaws, primarily stemming from the potential inequity this solution may create.  Those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder may find themselves in a position where they are unable to travel during certain times because the system is price prohibitive.  In the most extreme case, individuals may find themselves in a de facto prison, unable to realistically travel at will.
