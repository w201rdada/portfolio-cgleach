## Society's incomplete approach

Drug and alcohol addiction has far reaching consequences both for users, and society writ large.  Over the past 50 years we've developed our understanding of the brain and, more importantly, human behavior.  Yet our primary method for helping individuals maintain sobriety has failed to evolve, with the 12 step program continuing to serve as the standard treatment option.  In 2016 it is estimated that 64,000 individuals died due to overdose, with societal costs in the hundreds of billions.<source>  

Addicts will often tell you that there are certain triggers that help precipitate relapse (e.g. Holidays), and in some cases they are only evident after the fact.  However, could it be possible for deep learning to pinpoint changes in behavioral patterns, and use this information to launch targeted interventions in an effort to reduce the probability of relapse?  This proposal posits that the 12 step program is an incomplete solution, and that the efficacy of addiction treatment can be bolstered by capitilizing on the advances in data science and the near complete integration humans now have with technology.

## Bringing modernity to addiction treatment.

To some extent a paradigm shift is already underway, with companies like Ginger.io and Talkspace bringing traditional mental health services to user's mobile devices.  However, there is a crucial shortcoming in these offerings: Current services focus on providing support reactively--only when the user requests it--rather than proactively.  This approach will fail if either 1) the individual chooses not to reach out in their most vulnerable moment, or 2) the journey to that moment begins much earlier.  A mobile app, granted permissions across the user's device (texts, web history, app data, location, etc.), could resolve both of these problems through proactive intervention.

### Product Vision

The polished product will be capable of monitoring user behavior in real time and interveneing if the backend algorithm suggests there is a high probability of relapse.  The method(s) of intervention would be configurable, and would range from a pre-written push notification, to specific parties being notified (e.g. Sponser).  Additionally, applicable partnerships would be sought out to stregthen the value proposition of the product such as providing listings for AA meetings.  This offering will serve as an effective tool to be used in a stand-alone setting, or in conjuncture with other treatment options.  


### Stage 1 Roadmap & Approach

While the aforementioned product is the ultimate vision, it can not be built without further research.   As such, the first stage would omit engineering, and would instead focus on answering the following two questions: 
        
        1) Is targetted intervention immediately prior to a relapse an effective prevention strategy?
        2) Are user's mobile activities predictive of relapse?  
        
        The answer to the first question is difficult to solve in a purely quantative fashion, as a technological approach to sobriety is somewhat novel; however, qualatitive/anecdotal evidence through surveys of addicts and addiction specialists may help shed light on this topic.
        
        The second question is one ripe for analytics! To begin a data set would need to be constructed of mobile activity along with relapse times and locations; there are two main challenges to this step.  First, the data would not be perfect, as dates/times of relapses would be derived from memory, and second, a volunteer population in the tens of thousands would need to be procurred.  These are legitimate roadblocks, however by partnering with hospitals, AA, and other institutions it may be possible to obtain the necessary data.  Once the data is clean, a variety of data science techniques can be applied in an attempt to output a 'relapse probability score'.  Because there are so many different forms of mobile data, it would be best to bifurcate the data between  quantatitive data  (location, date, time, etc.) and linguistic data (text content, web search history, etc.).  The initial approach would be to use XGBoost (classifier) for the quantitative data, and a neural net for linguistic data.  In the event these approaches fail to produce significant results other methods will be tried.
        
    

### Privacy concerns



## A small, but necessary step towards the future.
In the end, it may be possible that the dynamics of addiction are too complex to predict, or the trends too weak to be useful.  And even given a perfect outcome in this first research stage, no solution will ever completely eliminate addiction, with this approach at best constituting an additional tool.  However, if we as a society fail to explore new technologies which might benefit the most vulnerable then we will have missed an enormous opportunity. 

Take a second to imagine what society would look like if the efficacy of our addiction treatment improved.
