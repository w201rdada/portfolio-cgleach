This is still a work in progress so check back again in the future. Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract of my first cool idea My first idea revolves around the use of new data science techniques to solve one of the biggest challenges in urban planning: Traffic! The aim is to use cutting edge techniques to empower states and municipalities to employ dynamic pricing in order to achieve their policy objectives (Reduced traffic, increased taxes, etc.). Abstract of my second cool idea My second idea aims to bring modern data science techniques to addiction treatment. The aim is to determine whether mobile usage is a predictor of relapse, and if so, can automatic technology driven intervention serve as an effective deterrent against relapse. The first stage of the project focuses on answering those research questions, and obtaining the necessary data to do the analysis; a second stage–building a mobile application–would be launched if the initial analysis yields positive results.

Unfortunately, the infastructure required to accomodate these demographic shifts has not been built, and as a result traffic has increased. And while it may be easy to forget, traffic doesn’t simply cause emotional and mental anguish! In 2013 researchers estimated the cost of congestion to be $1,700 for a car owning household (INRIX). knitr::include_graphics(‘img/HOPE-FRUSTRATION.png’) In the absense of massive infastructure investment, states and municipalities must begin to consider alternatives to reduce both the direct and indirect costs of traffic. This proposal will outline both the rationale and methodology for taking a data science approach to dynamic pricing–charging cars a variable rate to drive on a highway–which has the potential to drastically modify the current urban landscape. 1.2 Dynamic Pricing: The how and why 1.2.0.1 Why Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing is not a new concept. Anyone who has ever used Uber or purchased an airline ticket has experienced dynamic pricing whether they were aware of it or not. Companies use dynamic pricing because it allows them to match demand with supply, ensuring they maximize profits. knitr::include_graphics(‘img/dynamic-pricing.png’,fig.cap=‘(“Out with the old, in with the new”,2017)’,) States and municipalities can take a similar approach, setting tolls so that the number of drivers willing to pay the toll at a given point in time (demand) matches the number of cars the highway can handle without traffic (supply). Implementing this strategy would force price discovery, with individuals who are willing to pay more doing so, while providing those who could chooes to drive at a different time the option to save money. If done correctly, this has the potential to significantly reduce traffic while raising money which can be used to fund infastructure projects. Given the aformentioned costs of congestion, the ability for a city or state to reduce traffic is an extremely attractive value proposition. 1.2.0.2 But how will we know the correct price? The million dollar question is not whether dynamic pricing should be used, but how to actually set toll prices to achieve the desired level of traffic. To do this a complex model capable of predicting traffic given a variety of inputs–price, weather, day, time, etc.– must be created. And this is not a new idea; academics have considered this problem and attempted to analyze different methodologies and frameworks for years. Additionally, several states have already begun testing versions of this strategy: In Texas the TEXpress program uses variable pricing in certain highways with the aim of maintaining an average traffic speed on 50 MPH (“LBJ TEXpress Lanes”, 2018), and in Virginia public-private partnerships were formed to yield new variable pricing lanes on I95 an I495 (“Project Background”,2018). These programs demonstrate the feasibility and success of a dynamic approach, yet given the rapid advancements in data science and cloud computing there is opportunity to improve upon previous research and pricing models. 1.2.0.3 Model Methodology This project would begin by gathering publically available traffic, weather, demographic, pricing, and “event” (e.g. concert) data to build the initial model. Two approaches would initially be tested, 1) a neural net, and 2) a boosted decision tree, with the more predictive model being used in production. But that is only stage one! The exciting part begins when states begin to implement this new model, as new data would feed back into the system, helping to improve the efficacy of the initial algorithm. This in turn would serve as incentive for additional states and cities to adopt this offering, creating a positive feedback loop. Because this project calls for ingesting large amounts of data, a robust storage and machine learning stack will be required that can easily scale. Given the broad array of services offered, this project will utilize AWS, both for computation and data storage (S3). 1.3 A not too distant future Upon the completion of the model, states would have the ability to understand their expected traffic vs. price function, and take steps to more appropriately allign reality with the state’s societal and economic goals. If implemented, the expectation would be an increase in economic activity, and a reduction in lost time. Yet this proposal is not without flaws, primarily stemming from the potential inequity this solution might create. Those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder may find themselves in a position where they are unable to travel during certain times because the system is price prohibitive. There are many potential solutions to this issue, including a cap and trade program, tax credits, and entitlement programs which would provide resources for travel to those in need, however identifying the correct approach is beyond the scope of this proposal. In summary, we are witnessing the “tragedy of the commons” manifest itself in our highway system…but a data driven, dynamic pricing system will help correct preference misallignment, resulting in positive benefits for all stakeholders. 1.4 Bibliography LBJ TEXpress Lanes Overview and Maps.

And while our understanding of the brain, and more importantly, human behvaior has progressed over the past 50 years, our primary method for helping individuals maintain sobriety has not. Despite all of humanities advancements the 12 step program continues to serve as the standard treatment option. Addicts will often tell you that there are certain triggers that help precipitate relapse (e.g. Holidays), but in some cases they are only evident after the fact, or not evident to the human eye. Yet, could it be possible for deep learning to pinpoint these triggers via changes in behavioral patterns, and use this information to launch targeted interventions to reduce the probability of relapse? This proposal posits that the 12 step program is an incomplete solution, and that the efficacy of addiction treatment can be bolstered by capitalizing on the advances in data science and the near complete integration humans now have with technology. 2.2 Bringing modernity to addiction treatment. To some extent a paradigm shift is already underway, with companies like Ginger.io and Talkspace bringing traditional mental health services to user’s mobile devices. However, there is a crucial shortcoming in these offerings: Current services focus on providing support reactively–only when the user requests it–rather than proactively. This approach will fail if either 1) the individual chooses not to reach out in their most vulnerable moment, or 2) the journey to that moment begins much earlier. A mobile app, granted permissions across the user’s device (texts, web history, app data, location, etc.), could resolve both problems through proactive intervention. 2.2.0.1 Product Vision The polished product will be capable of monitoring user behavior in real time, and intervening if the backend algorithm suggests there is a high probability of relapse. The method(s) of intervention would be configurable, and would range from a pre-written push notification, to specific parties being notified (e.g. Sponsor). Additionally, applicable partnerships would be sought out to strengthen the value proposition of the product, such as providing listings for AA/NA meetings. The hope is that this offering will serve as an effective tool to be used either in a stand-alone fashion, or in conjuncture with other treatment options. 2.2.0.2 Stage 1 Roadmap &amp; Approach While the aforementioned product is the end goal, it cannot be built without further research. As such, the first stage of this project would omit engineering, and would instead focus on answering the following two questions: 1) Is targeted intervention immediately prior to a relapse an effective prevention strategy? 2) Are user&#39;s mobile activities predictive of relapse? The answer to the first question is difficult to solve in a purely quantitative fashion, as a technological approach to sobriety is somewhat novel; however, qualitative evidence through surveys of addicts and addiction specialists may help shed light on this topic. The primary survey question of interest would be whether speaking with someone when on the verge of relapse was succesful in modifying behavior. The second question is one better suited for analytics, however before any analysis can be done a data set would need to be constructed of mobile activity along with relapse times and locations; there are two main challenges to this step. First, the data would not be perfect, as dates/times of relapses would be derived from memory, and second, a volunteer population in the tens (or hundreds!) of thousands would need to be procured. These are legitimate roadblocks, however by partnering with hospitals, AA, and other institutions and anonymizing the data, it may be possible to obtain the necessary data, especially since volunteers would know the data is being used for a cause they are personally close to. Once the data is clean, a variety of data science techniques can be applied in an attempt to output a ‘relapse probability score’. Because there are so many different forms of mobile data, it would be best to bifurcate the data between quantitative data (location, date, time, etc.) and linguistic data (text content, web search history, etc.). The initial approach would be to use XGBoost (classifier) for the quantitative data, and a neural net for linguistic data. Assuming significant results are obtained, the project would proceed to stage 2, where the mobile applications and product backend are constructed. 2.3 A small step towards the future. In the end, it may be possible that the dynamics of addiction are too complex to predict, or the trends too weak to be useful. And even given a perfect outcome in this first research stage, no solution will ever eliminate addiction, with this approach at best constituting an additional tool. However, given the scope of this problem, even minor improvements in the status quo translate to significant human and financial savings. Take a second to imagine what society would look like if the efficacy of our addiction treatment improved. Isn’t that a world worth pursuing? 2.4 Bibliography National Institute of Drug Abuse.
