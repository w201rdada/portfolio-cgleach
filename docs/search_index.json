This is still a work in progress so check back again in the future. Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract of my first cool idea My first idea revolves around the use of new data science techniques to solve one of the biggest challenges in urban planning: Traffic! The aim is to use cutting edge techniques to empower stakeholders to employ dynamic pricing in order to achieve some outcome (Reduced traffic, increased taxes, etc.) Abstract of my third cool idea My second idea aims to bring modern data science techniques to addiction treatment. The aim is to determine whether mobile usage is a predictor of relapse, and if so, can automatic technology driven intervention serve as an effective deterrent against relapse. The first stage of the project focuses on answering those research questions, and obtaining the necessary data to do the analysis; a second stage–building a mobile application–would be launched if the initial analysis yields positive results. About the author Clayton Leach is a student in the Berkeley MIDS program in the Spring 2018 Cohort. He lives in Philadelphia, PA (Go Eagles!) where he works in advertising technology as a product analyst. Upon completion of the MIDS program Clayton hopes to gain employment as a data science.

Over the past decade the United States has seen a sustained trend of individuals moving from the periphery into urban centers. Unfortunately, the infastructure required to accomodate these demographic shifts has not been built, and as a result traffic has increased. And while it may be easy to forget, traffic doesn’t simply cause emotional and mental anguish! In 2013 The Centre for Economics and Business Research, in collaboration with INRIX, released a study that estimated the cost of congestion to be $1,700 for a car owning household (Source). Given the material nature of this issue, solutions must be discovered. 1.2 A middle. In the absense of massive infastructure investment, states must begin to consider alternatives to reduce both the direct and indirect costs of traffic. One solution would be to implement dynamic pricing, charging cars a variable rate to drive on a highway depending on specific factors, such as time of day, road conditions, number of passengers, etc. If done correctly, this has the potential to significantly reduce traffic and raise money which can be used to fund additional projects. In many ways this would represent a form of price discovery, with individuals who are willing to pay more doing so, and those who could chooes to drive at a different time having the option to save money. However if this undertaking is to be achieved, a complex model capable of predicting traffic given a variety of inputs must be created. And this is not a new idea; academics have considered this problem and attempted to analyze different methodologies and frameworks for years. Additionally, several states have already begun testing versions of this strategy: In Texa the TEXpress program uses variable pricing in certain highways with the aim of maintaining an average traffic speed on 50 MPH (Source), and in Virginia public-private partnerships were formed to yield new variable pricing lanes on I95 an I495. Yet with the advent of cloud computing and newer machine learning techniques, there may be an opportunity to improve upon previous research and price modeling. Using publically available traffic, weather, demographic, and toll data, a large scale neural network could be created which might better capture the complexity of variable interaction. As state’s begin to implement this model, new data would feed back into the system, helping to improve the efficacy of the initial algorithim. Because of this, the project has the potential for exponential data growth, and a robust storage and machine learning stack will be required that can easily scale. Additionally, given the size of the data set, a parallel processing solution will be necessary; fortunely, all of these tools are now standard in cloud solutions (AWS/Google Cloud, etc). 1.3 An end. Upon the completion of the model, states would have the ability to understand their expected traffic vs. price function, and take steps to more appropriately allign reality with the state’s societal and economic goals. If implemented, the expectation would be an increase in economic activity, and a reduction in lost time. Yet this proposal is not without flaws, primarily stemming from the potential inequity this solution might create. Those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder may find themselves in a position where they are unable to travel during certain times because the system is price prohibitive. There are many potential solutions to this issue, including a cap and trade program, tax credits, and entitlement programs which would provide resources for travel to those in need, however identifying the correct approach is beyond the scope of this proposal. In summary, we are witnessing the tragedy of the commons manifest itself in our highways system, but a data driven, dynamic pricing system can help correct preference misallignment, which in turn will yield numerous positive benefits. 1.4 Bibliography LBJ TEXpress Lanes Overview and Maps.

And while our understanding of the brain, and more importantly, human behvaior has progressed over the past 50 years, our primary method for helping individuals maintain sobriety has not. Despite all of humanities advancements the 12 step program continues to serve as the standard treatment option. (#fig:Rising Alcoholism Rates)Hello World! Addicts will often tell you that there are certain triggers that help precipitate relapse (e.g. Holidays), but in some cases they are only evident after the fact, or not evident to the human eye. Yet, could it be possible for deep learning to pinpoint these triggers via changes in behavioral patterns, and use this information to launch targeted interventions to reduce the probability of relapse? This proposal posits that the 12 step program is an incomplete solution, and that the efficacy of addiction treatment can be bolstered by capitalizing on the advances in data science and the near complete integration humans now have with technology. 2.2 Bringing modernity to addiction treatment. To some extent a paradigm shift is already underway, with companies like Ginger.io and Talkspace bringing traditional mental health services to user’s mobile devices. However, there is a crucial shortcoming in these offerings: Current services focus on providing support reactively–only when the user requests it–rather than proactively. This approach will fail if either 1) the individual chooses not to reach out in their most vulnerable moment, or 2) the journey to that moment begins much earlier. A mobile app, granted permissions across the user’s device (texts, web history, app data, location, etc.), could resolve both problems through proactive intervention. 2.2.0.1 Product Vision The polished product will be capable of monitoring user behavior in real time, and intervening if the backend algorithm suggests there is a high probability of relapse. The method(s) of intervention would be configurable, and would range from a pre-written push notification, to specific parties being notified (e.g. Sponsor). Additionally, applicable partnerships would be sought out to strengthen the value proposition of the product, such as providing listings for AA/NA meetings. The hope is that this offering will serve as an effective tool to be used either in a stand-alone fashion, or in conjuncture with other treatment options. 2.2.0.2 Stage 1 Roadmap &amp; Approach While the aforementioned product is the end goal, it cannot be built without further research. As such, the first stage of this project would omit engineering, and would instead focus on answering the following two questions: 1) Is targeted intervention immediately prior to a relapse an effective prevention strategy? 2) Are user&#39;s mobile activities predictive of relapse? The answer to the first question is difficult to solve in a purely quantitative fashion, as a technological approach to sobriety is somewhat novel; however, qualitative evidence through surveys of addicts and addiction specialists may help shed light on this topic. The primary survey question of interest would be whether speaking with someone when on the verge of relapse was succesful in modifying behavior. The second question is one better suited for analytics, however before any analysis can be done a data set would need to be constructed of mobile activity along with relapse times and locations; there are two main challenges to this step. First, the data would not be perfect, as dates/times of relapses would be derived from memory, and second, a volunteer population in the tens (or hundreds!) of thousands would need to be procured. These are legitimate roadblocks, however by partnering with hospitals, AA, and other institutions and anonymizing the data, it may be possible to obtain the necessary data, especially since volunteers would know the data is being used for a cause they are personally close to. Once the data is clean, a variety of data science techniques can be applied in an attempt to output a ‘relapse probability score’. Because there are so many different forms of mobile data, it would be best to bifurcate the data between quantitative data (location, date, time, etc.) and linguistic data (text content, web search history, etc.). The initial approach would be to use XGBoost (classifier) for the quantitative data, and a neural net for linguistic data. Assuming significant results are obtained, the project would proceed to stage 2, where the mobile applications and product backend are constructed. 2.3 A small step towards the future. In the end, it may be possible that the dynamics of addiction are too complex to predict, or the trends too weak to be useful. And even given a perfect outcome in this first research stage, no solution will ever eliminate addiction, with this approach at best constituting an additional tool. However, given the scope of this problem, even minor improvements in the status quo translate to significant human and financial savings. Take a second to imagine what society would look like if the efficacy of our addiction treatment improved. Isn’t that a world worth pursuing? 2.4 Bibliography National Institute of Drug Abuse.
