["pricing-traffic.html", "1 Traffic, Congestion, and Dynamic Pricing 1.1 A beginning. 1.2 A middle. 1.3 An end.", " 1 Traffic, Congestion, and Dynamic Pricing Keywords Dynamic pricing, traffic, congestion, jam 1.1 A beginning. Over the past decade the United States has seen a sustained trend of individuals moving from the periphery into urban centers. Unfortunately, the infastructure required to accomodate these demographic shifts has not been built, and as a result traffic has increased. And while it may be easy to forget, traffic doesn’t simply cause emotional and mental anguish! In 2013 The Centre for Economics and Business Research, in collaboration with INRIX, released a study that estimated the cost of congestion to be $1,700 for a car owning household (Source). Given the material nature of this issue, solutions must be discovered. 1.2 A middle. In the absense of massive infastructure investment, states must begin to consider alternatives to reduce both the direct and indirect costs of traffic. One solution would be to implement dynamic pricing, charging cars a variable rate to drive on a highway depending on specific factors, such as time of day, road conditions, number of passengers, etc. If done correctly, this has the potential to significantly reduce traffic and raise money which can be used to fund additional projects. In many ways this would represent a form of price discovery, with individuals who are willing to pay more doing so, and those who could chooes to drive at a different time having the option to save money. However if this undertaking is to be achieved, a complex model capable of predicting traffic given a variety of inputs must be created. And this is not a new idea; academics have considered this problem and attempted to analyze different methodologies and frameworks for years. Additionally, several states have already begun testing versions of this strategy: In Texa the TEXpress program uses variable pricing in certain highways with the aim of maintaining an average traffic speed on 50 MPH (Source), and in Virginia public-private partnerships were formed to yield new variable pricing lanes on I95 an I495. Yet with the advent of cloud computing and newer machine learning techniques, there may be an opportunity to improve upon previous research and price modeling. Using publically available traffic, weather, demographic, and toll data, a large scale neural network could be created which might better capture the complexity of variable interaction. As state’s begin to implement this model, new data would feed back into the system, helping to improve the efficacy of the initial algorithim. Because of this, the project has the potential for exponential data growth, and a robust storage and machine learning stack will be required that can easily scale. Additionally, given the size of the data set, a parallel processing solution will be necessary; fortunely, all of these tools are now standard in cloud solutions (AWS/Google Cloud, etc). 1.3 An end. Upon the completion of the model, states would have the ability to understand their expected traffic vs. price function, and take steps to more appropriately allign reality with the state’s societal and economic goals. If implemented, the expectation would be an increase in economic activity, and a reduction in lost time. Yet this proposal is not without flaws, primarily stemming from the potential inequity this solution might create. Those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder may find themselves in a position where they are unable to travel during certain times because the system is price prohibitive. There are many potential solutions to this issue, including a cap and trade program, tax credits, and entitlement programs which would provide resources for travel to those in need, however identifying the correct approach is beyond the scope of this proposal. In summary, we are witnessing the tragedy of the commons manifest itself in our highways system, but a data driven, dynamic pricing system can help correct preference misallignment, which in turn will yield numerous positive benefits.

["a-21st-century-approach-to-addiction.html", "2 A 21st Century Approach to Addiction 2.1 A beginning. 2.2 A middle. 2.3 An end.", " 2 A 21st Century Approach to Addiction Keywords NLP, machine learning, deep learning, addiction, sobriety, overdose 2.1 A beginning. Drug and alcohol addiction has far reaching consequences both for users, and society writ large. Over the past 50 years we’ve developed our understanding of the brain and, more importantly, human behavior. Yet our primary method for helping individuals maintain sobriety has failed to change, with the 12 step program continuing to serve as the standard treatment. In 2016 the National Institue on Drug Abuse estimated that 64,000 individuals died due to overdose, with societal costs in the hundreds of billions. Take a second to imagine what society would look like if the efficacy of our addiction treatment improved. Isn’t that a world worth pursuing? 2.2 A middle. Addicts will often tell you that there are certain triggers that help precipitate relapse, and in some cases they are only evident after the fact. Yet it is highly possible, even probable, that deep learning could pinpoint changes in behavioral patterns, and use these findings to launch a targeted intervention to help reduce the probability of relapse. This proposal posits that a mobile app, which is granted permissions across the user’s device (texts, web history, app data, location, etc.) could preemptively identify behaviors which predict relapse. The model would combine NLP (texts, websearch, etc.) with additional variables to predict relapse, and then intervene (e.g. NLP identifies anger in most recent texts, followed by GPS data which indicates driving to a location within some distance of a bar…text the user with the message they created for themselves when using the app). While the aforementioned product is the ultimate vision, this project is most likely to succeed in an iterative and agile environment. As such, the first stage would omit engineering, and would instead focus on answering the following two questions: 1) Is targetted intervention immediately prior to a relapse effective at preventing it, and 2) can a user’s mobile activity predict sobriety? The answer to the first question is difficult to solve in a purely quantative fashion, as a technological approach to sobriety is somewhat novel; however, qualatitive/anecdotal evidence through surveys of addicts and addiction specialists may help shed light on this topic. The second questions is one ripe for analytics! To begin, a data set would need to be created which includes users, all of their mobile activity, and the associated relapse times of each individual. The data set would not be perfect, as dates/times of relapses would be derived from memory, and the data set would be constructed entirely from volunteers. However, a large enough sample population would mitigate these concerns. Once the data is procurred and cleaned, a variety of machine learning techniques could be applied in an effort to see if any of them are predictive. In the event the initial findings are positive, next steps can be taken to move the initiative forward. 2.3 An end. In the end, it may be possible that the dynamics of addiction are too complex to predict, or the trends too weak to be useful. And even given a perfect outcome in this first research stage, no solution will ever completely eliminate addiction, with this approach at best constituting an additional tool. However, if we as a society fail to explore new technologies which might benefit the most vulnerable then we will have missed an enormous opportunity. https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates "],
