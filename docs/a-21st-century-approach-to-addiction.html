<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> A beginning.</h2>
<p>Drug and alcohol addiction has far reaching consequences both for users, and society writ large. Over the past 50 years we’ve developed our understanding of the brain and, more importantly, human behavior. Yet our primary method for helping individuals maintain sobriety has failed to change, with the 12 step program continuing to serve as the standard treatment. In 2016 the National Institue on Drug Abuse estimated that 64,000 individuals died due to overdose, with societal costs in the hundreds of billions. Take a second to imagine what society would look like if the efficacy of our addiction treatment improved. Isn’t that a world worth pursuing?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> A middle.</h2>
<p>Addicts will often tell you that there are certain triggers that help precipitate relapse, and in some cases they are only evident after the fact. Yet it is highly possible, even probable, that deep learning could pinpoint changes in behavioral patterns, and use these findings to launch a targeted intervention to help reduce the probability of relapse. This proposal posits that a mobile app, which is granted permissions across the user’s device (texts, web history, app data, location, etc.) could preemptively identify behaviors which predict relapse. The model would combine NLP (texts, websearch, etc.) with additional variables to predict relapse, and then intervene (e.g. NLP identifies anger in most recent texts, followed by GPS data which indicates driving to a location within some distance of a bar…text the user with the message they created for themselves when using the app).<br />
While the aforementioned product is the ultimate vision, this project is most likely to succeed in an iterative and agile environment. As such, the first stage would omit engineering, and would instead focus on answering the following two questions: 1) Is targetted intervention immediately prior to a relapse effective at preventing it, and 2) can a user’s mobile activity predict sobriety? The answer to the first question is difficult to solve in a purely quantative fashion, as a technological approach to sobriety is somewhat novel; however, qualatitive/anecdotal evidence through surveys of addicts and addiction specialists may help shed light on this topic. The second questions is one ripe for analytics! To begin, a data set would need to be created which includes users, all of their mobile activity, and the associated relapse times of each individual. The data set would not be perfect, as dates/times of relapses would be derived from memory, and the data set would be constructed entirely from volunteers. However, a large enough sample population would mitigate these concerns. Once the data is procurred and cleaned, a variety of machine learning techniques could be applied in an effort to see if any of them are predictive. In the event the initial findings are positive, next steps can be taken to move the initiative forward.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> An end.</h2>
<p>In the end, it may be possible that the dynamics of addiction are too complex to predict, or the trends too weak to be useful. And even given a perfect outcome in this first research stage, no solution will ever completely eliminate addiction, with this approach at best constituting an additional tool. However, if we as a society fail to explore new technologies which might benefit the most vulnerable then we will have missed an enormous opportunity.</p>
